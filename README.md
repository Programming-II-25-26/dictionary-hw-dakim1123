# Dictionary HW

Please answer the 3 problems below. You may look things up and can use methods but make sure you understand them and would be able to explain what the method is doing and how it works. 


1. Write a Python function to check whether a given key already exists in a dictionary.

2. Write a Python script to generate and print a dictionary that contains a number (between 1 and n) in the form (x, x*x).

      Input: n = 5
      Expected Output : {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}

3. Write a Python script that prints all of the duplicate characters in a string.
  Problem: Given a string s, the task is to identify all characters that appear more than once and print each as a list containing the character and its count.

  Examples:
  
      Input: s = "northwestschool"
      Output: ['o', 3], ['s', 3]
      Explanation: Characters o and s appear more than once. Their counts are shown in order of first occurrence.
  
      Input: s = "programming"
      Output: ['r', 2], ['g', 2], ['m', 2]
      Explanation: Only r, g, and m are duplicates. Output lists them with their counts.
  
      Input: s = "mississippi"
      Output: ['i', 4], ['s', 4], ['p', 2]
      Explanation: Characters i, s, and p have multiple occurrences. The output reflects that with count and order preserved.


4. Write a Python program to create a new dictionary by extracting the mentioned keys from the below dictionary.

      Given dictionary:
        sample_dict = {
            "name": "Kelly",
            "age": 25,
            "salary": 8000,
            "city": "New york"}
      
      Keys to extract:
        keys = ["name", "salary"]
      
      Expected output:
      {'name': 'Kelly', 'salary': 8000}
